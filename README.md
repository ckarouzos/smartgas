# Smartgas
This application was developped as part of the 9th semester course, Software Engineering (of the National Technical University of Athens) taught by Konstantinos Saidis and Vasilios Veskoukis in the winter semester of 2018.This project was developped by a team of 6 members known as motherhackers.

## This application is developped using the below technologies :

  ### Back-end 
  The Back endpoint of this application was developped using NodeJS and express . We should also mention that the main database of this     project is MySQL. We also used an in memory NoSQL database (Redis) in order to invalidate Json Web Tokens of users that  have logged      out.
  
  ### Front-end
  The Front endpoint of this application was developped using not only HTML5 but also AngularJS.
  
  ### Test Automation
  In order to test our back end server for bugs and possible errors we run 255 tests using the Jest automation framework.
  
  ### Building Automation
  We used GULP as the building automation framework. 
  
## How to run this Application ? 
  1) At first you should have MySQL and Redis install in your UNIX computer.
  2) After this and assuming that you have configured the databases correctly just type --> npm i gulp gulp-cli gulp-multi-process npm
  3) Finnaly type --> $(npm bin)/gulp in order to install dependencies, run the automated tests and start the servers
